            <p>This is where you can learn all about me and all things creative. I am a newbie designer navigating the world of graphic design, illustration and photography.</p>
            <p>I am currently attending school for graphic design. Going to school for a more creative career has been exciting and challenging. I am proud of myself for trying something new and out of my comfort zone but also nervous of the unknown. I am taking it one step at a time. So far, I am enjoying this more than I have ever enjoyed school, which I take as a good sign. I am excited to see where this leads.</p>
            <p>Please take a look around, I'd love to <a id="email" href="mailto:info@joy-portfolio.com?subject=Website Inquiry">stay in touch</a>! And thank you for visiting!</p>

            <p>I am all about creativity and nature. I love the outdoors, taking pictures, illustration and design. Incorporating nature has become the overlapping theme in all my works.</p>
